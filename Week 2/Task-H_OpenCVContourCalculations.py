# This is task H - > OpenCV "Contour Calculations."  Not sure if it is clear by now, 
# but OpenCV can do a lot of things, we need to understand what it offers to complete 
# our vision code.  For a given single contour, (meaning it was imaged and masked and 
# converted to a coordinate array), you need to be able to use a number of OpenCV functions.
# Please experiment with the following, easiest is to simply draw them back to a blank image
# or on top of original.

# --> moments, contour area, contour perimeter, contour approximation, bounding rectangles, 
# minimum enclosing circle, fitting elipse, fitting line, etc.
