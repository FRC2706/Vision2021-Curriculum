# This is a pseudo code file for Merge Robotics, 2021, Game Changers

# This is task B -> Colorize Retro-Reflective Tape only to equivalent of pure green RGB:0,255,0

# Put the colorized photos into a different sub-folder in your repo

# Eventually we will want the photos standardized to a smallish resolution similar to that used on the robot, let's say 640x480 max.
#Updated 10 images using Irfan view to RGB green and stored in a subfolder
