# Vision2021-Curriculum
This repository is for Merge Robotics, 2021 and Game Changers

We will be working through the tasks located in each week's folder, to:
  - learn Python, the simple use of Github, as well as VSCode
  - and most importantly the basic tools available in OpenCV
  - with the objective of learning how to solve a typical FRC vision challenge

The basic workflow for FRC vision is Good Image, Good Mask and good Math.  Let's call this "GIGMM"!  An acronym to remember the workflow.

We will not need a robot, or specific hardware, other than a computer with Python and OpenCV.
